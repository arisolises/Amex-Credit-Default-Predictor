# Amex-Credit-Default-Predictor

Leveraging my expertise in data analysis, feature engineering, and advanced modeling techniques to develop a predictive model that surpasses the performance of the existing credit default prediction model used by American Express. With access to a vast dataset containing time-series behavioral data and anonymized customer profiles, I am equipped with the resources to uncover valuable insights and trends that will enable me to make accurate credit default predictions.

By exploring novel techniques and pushing the boundaries of innovation, I am determined to create a robust and reliable model that optimizes lending decisions and ultimately improves the customer journey. This project presents an opportunity to challenge the status quo and introduce new methodologies that can redefine the credit industry's approach to risk management.

Join me on this exciting adventure as we leverage the power of data science and machine learning to shape the future of credit default prediction. Together, let's unlock the potential within the dataset and make a lasting impact on risk management practices, paving the way for a more efficient and customer-centric credit industry.
